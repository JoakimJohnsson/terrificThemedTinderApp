# TTTAI - Terrific Themed Tinder AI app

I will mainly follow the tutorial, with a few changes. Instead of the usual Tinder app, I will try to make it easy to
implement different themes to chose from - Cats, dogs etc. This will be more fun than a Tinder app.

## Backend

I will probably not make any big changes here. Just adjust the models where needed.

## Frontend

I will use FontAwesome Pro icons. And try out the Bulma css framework. I will also use Google fonts.
